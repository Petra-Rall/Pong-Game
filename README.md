## 🕹️ Pong Game in C++ using Raylib

This is a simple Pong game built using the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library.
It has been optimized for **Linux systems** only.

### 🛠️ Requirements (for building from source)

* Raylib library installed
* g++ compiler
* OpenGL, X11, and related development libraries (usually available in most distros)

### ▶️ Run the Game

You can play the game directly using the **precompiled binary** provided:

```bash
chmod +x PongGame
./PongGame
```

Make sure the terminal is in the folder where `PongGame` is located.

> No need to install Raylib if you're using the precompiled binary — it is statically linked.
